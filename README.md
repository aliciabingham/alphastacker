##Description
Alphastacker was very important to the JavaScript quiz. The JavaScript quiz required us to build a "christmas tree" out of whatever character an end user would select.

In Alphastacker, we took an array of letters, stacked them up, and put a space every fifth letter. I used nested for loops to accomplish this.

##How To Run
In your terminal, run command ```http-server -p 4040```.

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
